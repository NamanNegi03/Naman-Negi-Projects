# Naman Negi - Portfolio and Project Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!  
I'm **Naman Negi**, a software developer and computer vision engineer specializing in ANPR systems, facial recognition, IoT integrations, machine learning model training, and full-stack development.  

This repo serves as a comprehensive archive and detailed explanation of my professional and personal projects, including work featured on my [resume website](https://fantastic-travesseiro-3f7b27.netlify.app) and my [ANPR web app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NamanNegi03/private-anpr-model).  

**Note:** Source code is kept in private repositories for security. This repo focuses on **high-level explanations, processes, and outcomes**.

It covers:
- My work history  
- Key projects  
- Technical skills  
- Step-by-step breakdowns  

The aim is to provide transparency, serve as a reference, and document knowledge transfer for complex integrations.
